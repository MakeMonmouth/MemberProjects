# MemberProjects

Various projects created by our members for the public to download and play with.

## How does this work?

This repository is full of things that have been released as [open source projects](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) by our members for the wider community to use.

The projects are licensed under the [GPL v3 License](https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0) by default, granting anyone the right to take the code and use it for whatever they want, modify it however they like, and even make money from it, as long as they contribute back any changes they make and keep the copyright notices to ensure proper attribution of work done, however a project may choose to adopt a different license and, if they choose this route, will add a LICENSE file to the folder that contains their code.

## How do I use it?

Clone this repository to your local computer, then follow the instructions in the folder of the project you want to build.

## Who do I contact if things aren't working?

The best person to contact in the first instance is the person who created the project.

You should be able to find their details in the README.md file in the project folder, but if that's not available then you can always [join our discord](https://discord.gg/DN8Rup7g4t) and chat with us there.

## I have a concern about the content in this repository

You should always try and contact the person that created the code, but if you can't get hold of them, please [contact us via email](mailto:info@makemonmouth.co.uk?subject=Github) and we'll do our best to resolve your concerns.
